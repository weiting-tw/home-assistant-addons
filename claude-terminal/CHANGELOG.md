# Changelog

## 1.9.0 - 2026-02-17

### 🆕 Features
- **Session persistence with tmux** — Reconnecting to the terminal resumes your previous Claude session instead of starting a new one
- **Mobile-friendly session picker** — Single-key controls (r=resume, n=new, l=list, s=shell, q=quit), no need to type numbers + Enter
- **Auto-resume on reconnect** — When a tmux session exists, connecting automatically attaches to it (no menu needed)
- **Enter key = Resume** — Just press Enter to quickly resume the last conversation

### 🔧 Changes
- Added `tmux` to container packages
- ttyd now connects through tmux for persistent sessions
- Session picker redesigned with simpler key bindings
- Claude exits return to menu instead of closing the terminal

- **Reduced `hassio_role`** from `manager` to `default`
- **Disabled `homeassistant_api`** and `auth_api`

### 🔒 Security

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Added GitHub Actions workflow to build and push multi-arch Docker images to GHCR.

## 1.6.0 - 2026-01-26

### 🔄 Changed
- **Native Claude Code Installation**: Switched from npm package to official native installer
  - Uses `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` instead of `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
  - Native binary provides automatic background updates from Anthropic
  - Faster startup (no Node.js interpreter overhead)
  - Claude binary symlinked to `/usr/local/bin/claude` for easy access
- **Simplified execution**: All scripts now call `claude` directly instead of `node $(which claude)`

  - Packages installed via command or config are automatically reinstalled on startup
  - Supports both Home Assistant add-on config and local state file
  - Inspired by community contribution from [@ESJavadex](https://github.com/ESJavadex)

### 📦 Usage Examples
```bash
